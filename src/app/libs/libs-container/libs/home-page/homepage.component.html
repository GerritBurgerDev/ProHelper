            Okay, okay, yes, this is were we ask for some money. At the moment <b>ProHelper is fully run on donations</b> by the
            public and we need your help to stay afloat!

            <br>
            <br>

            At the moment we can only accept PayPal donations, however, we plan to accept CryptoCurrency donations soon.

            <br>
            <br>

            <b>We do not plan to stay donation funded forever.</b> Otherwise we won't be able to keep up with the costs of running
            this service. Hence, we plan to bring subscriptions to the web application, <b>users who have donated will not
            lose any privileges they had while we were donation funded</b> as a THANK YOU!, to them. Platforms added to ProHelper
            will also be required to pay a subscription and startup fee (please see <a [routerLink]="['/services']">our services</a> for more information).
